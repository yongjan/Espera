### Party-Mode

With the party-mode Espera can be locked, so your guests can't change the volume or stop the music anymore, while you can control the playback from your Android device.

If your guests also install the Android app, they can send songs from their phone to Espera, which are then added to the playlist.

### YouTube

Espera can search songs at YouTube, add them to the playlist and stream the video. This works completely seamless and songs on your local harddrive can be mixed with YouTube videos.

### SoundCloud

Just as with YouTube, you can seamlessly add songs from SoundCloud to your playlist.

### Metro (Modern UI)-Style

Espera uses [MahApps.Metro](http://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for theming. This gives Espera a beautiful and 
very clean look.

## Requirements

 - .NET Framework 4.5
 - Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista

## Development

Espera is written in C#, with WPF as frontend.

It also makes heavy uses of Reactive Extensions and ReactiveUI.
